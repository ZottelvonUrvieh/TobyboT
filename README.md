# **TobyboT**
## **Some quick disclaimers:**
> This is a Discord bot that I purely created for my own entertainment - for learning and fun.

> This project is based on [Voidbot](https://github.com/abyssvi/Voidbot) from [Abyss](https://github.com/abyssvi).
A lot of ideas, folder structure of the project and even some code is taken from there.
But I started completely fresh and rewrote everything from scratch so that is why it is not a fork...<br>
*For example how the commands are structured, how some of the different Managers/Handlers are intended to work, etc...*

> I honestly don't know if this bot works on Windows **at all** - never tested there

## **General Idea was to create a Bot skeletton that is:**
- Easy to use
- Extendable through Modules
- Easy to develop Modules for
- Multi purpose with Commands, Events and periodic Tasks
- Flexible with reloading Modules / Commands etc

## **TODOS:**
- [x] **DBManager**
  - [x] Interface
    - [x] Get an idea of a structure that I like
    - [x] Check for correct stucture of implemented Methods
  - [ ] Implementation
    - [ ] MongoDB implementation
      - [ ] Make it possible to use querries
      - [x] Creating Tables
      - [x] Inserting Documents
      - [x] deleteTable / setTableRows
      - [x] Move config to file so noone can use the DB access :) (now also in config.cfg)
    - [ ] LowDB implementation as fallback
- [x] **Logging**
  - [x] Different console log/debug/warnings/errors for:
    - [x] CoreBot

    - [x] General function to update any config that is in the file
    - [ ] Make a command that accepts two arguments to use that general function
  - [ ] Persist config better than currently handled (Is that neccessary?)
- [ ] **ModuleManager**
  - [x] Reloading Modules
  - [x] Flexible Permission loading / unloading
  - [ ] Code cleaning
- [ ] **ComponentManager**
  - [x] Parsing Message into Command / Args
  - [x] Checking for several things before Command execution:
    - [x] From bot?
    - [x] Valid Command?
    - [x] OwnersOnly Mode for this Command / Module enabled? Owner?
    - [x] Channel location correct?
  - [x] Possility to enable showCommandUsage on returning Error
  - [x] Reloading Commands
  - [x] Flexible Permission loading / unloading
  - [x] Manage duplicate cmd's / aliases
  - [ ] Code cleaning
  - [x] Run command from Help?

### **Modules/Extensions:**

      - [ ] Menu for sending out Night results
      - [ ] Whispers send to the bot in DM and depending on the settings of them they will be handled differently:

      - [ ] Forwarding to Spectator-Chat
      - [ ] Forwarding to Game-Chat 'X Messaged Y'
      - [ ] Forwarding to possible Power Roles

    - [ ] Showing results and / or sending out rolecards with or without notifying mods who is who
    - [ ] DMing Mafia / Other Roles the invites of other Servers
